# Setup Raspberry Pi Without Monitor or Keyboard
This is my step by step guidance to set up a Raspberry Pi.

## Install Raspbian

* Download Raspbian image from [here](http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/).
* Download and install [SD Formatter 4.0](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/). Then use it to format SD card.
* Download and install [Win32DiskImager](http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/). Then use it to write the Raspbian image into SD card.  
* Insert the SD card into Raspberry Pi, plug in the power cord and network cable, and then power on the Pi.
